        AI-Enhanced Emotional Communication: The EmoConnect Model for Bridging Human Relationships Digitally
      </h1>

      <p>
        Emotional misalignment is a growing concern in digital communication, where the absence of non-verbal cues often leads to misunderstandings and relationship strain. This study presents <strong>EmoConnect</strong>, an AI-powered system designed to enhance emotional synchronization in online interpersonal settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Embedded within the <strong>Self-Analysis psychological framework</strong>, EmoConnect creates a multilayered psychological profile—called the <strong>Self-Analysis Psychological DNA Code</strong>—by combining explicit self-reports and unconscious behavioral patterns. These data are processed through a machine learning model (SVM) that predicts emotional compatibility and offers personalized communication strategies.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quantitative study with 100 participants demonstrated a <strong>25% improvement</strong> in mutual emotional alignment (p &lt; .01), while a qualitative pilot confirmed practical benefits such as improved empathy and reduced conflict. EmoConnect translates deep psychological theory—including <strong>attachment styles</strong> and <strong>Transactional Analysis</strong>—into real-time emotional feedback, enabling users to understand and adjust their relational dynamics in digital environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        These findings position EmoConnect as a scalable tool for promoting healthier emotional interactions in virtual communication contexts.

        Plain Language Summary
      </h2>
      <p>
        Communicating true feelings in relationships can be difficult. We have created an artificial intelligence tool called <strong>EmoConnect</strong> that helps people better understand themselves and their partners. By creating a &quot;digital psychological profile&quot; for each person, this tool identifies their hidden communication patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our study, using EmoConnect improved mutual agreement between people by 25%, and 60% of participants in a real-world study reported fewer conflicts and better relationships. This research shows that artificial intelligence can be a powerful tool for building healthier relationships online.
