      <p className="mb-6">
        To excel as an **AI‑Powered Content Specialist**, you must adopt a holistic approach that combines traditional SEO practices with the cutting-edge strategies of **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** and **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**.

- Adding **Schema.org structured data markup**, especially FAQPage and HowTo schemas.  
- Providing concise, factual answers using bullet points and lists.

GEO ensures that **AI-driven systems choose your content as a reference**. Best practices:
- Producing **in-depth, authoritative content** that establishes trust.  
- Publishing **evergreen content** with frequent updates.  
- Using **semantic search techniques** by writing naturally and covering related topics in detail.  
- Adding an **llms.txt file** to guide AI crawlers and signal permissions.  
- Featuring **author profiles** with expertise and credentials for credibility.

A balanced strategy means:
